   Help:

1) How do I get my game's Steam AppID?

2) Why is the game not being cracked properly?
Some Steam games have the DLL hidden inside its
.exe file, which as for now, cannot be cracked
with QuickSC and need to be cracked manually.


---------------------------------------------

QuickSC (also known as QuickSteamCrack) is a
batch script that makes cracking Steam DRM
quick and easier.
It uses Goldberg's Steam Emulator.

It was made in less than a day, but it was
a pain to get it to finally work.

Batch sucks.
